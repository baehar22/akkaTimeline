                  <h1>Old City, `Akká –Baha'u'llah's arrival at the penal colony of `Akká</h1>
                  <p> Every time a Manifestation of God appears, a fuller measure of inspiration for the next stage in the awakening and progress of humanity is released into the world. 
                    In the middle of the 19th century, God summoned Bahá’u’lláh—meaning the “Glory of God”—to deliver a new Revelation to humanity, the Baha'i Faith. For four decades thousands of verses, letters and books flowed from His pen. <br> In His Writings, He outlined a framework for the development of a global civilization which takes into account both the spiritual and material dimensions of human life.
                    Bahá’u’lláh suffered 40 years of imprisonment, torture and exile for bringing God’s latest message to humanity. Today, His life and mission are becoming increasingly well-known across the planet. Millions of people are learning to apply His teachings to their individual and collective lives for the betterment of the world. <br> <br>
                    
                    His arrival at the penal colony of `Akká, far from proving the end of His afflictions, was but the beginning of a major crisis, characterized by bitter suffering, severe restrictions, and intense turmoil, which, in its gravity, surpassed even the agonies of the Síyáh-Chál of Tihrán, and to which no other event, in the history of the entire century can compare, except the internal convulsion that rocked the Faith in Adrianople. "Know thou," 
                    Bahá'u'lláh, wishing to emphasize the criticalness of the first nine years of His banishment to that prison-city, has written, "that upon Our arrival at this Spot, We chose to designate it as the `Most Great Prison.' Though previously subjected in another land (Tihrán) to chains and fetters, We yet refused to call it by that name. Say: Ponder thereon, O ye endued with understanding!" <br> - Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 185
                  <br> <br> "His enemies," `Abdu'l-Bahá, referring to this same theme, has written, "intended that His imprisonment should completely destroy and annihilate the blessed Cause, but this prison was, in reality, of the greatest assistance, and became the means of its development." "...This illustrious Being," He, moreover has affirmed, "uplifted His Cause in the Most Great Prison. From this Prison His light was shed abroad; His fame conquered the world, and the proclamation of His glory reached the East and the West." "His light at first had been a star; now it became a mighty sun." "Until our time," He, moreover has affirmed, "no such thing has ever occurred."
                  <br> Baha’u’llah spent the last 24 years of His life in the Prison City of `Akká.

                  <h1 class="f3 text--accent ttu">The Most Great Prison,`Akká –Baha'u'llah's imprisonment in `Akká</h1>
                  <p>It was 31 August, Baha’u’llah was taken from the sea gate, through the city’s narrow and winding alleys, to the barracks, used at the time as a prison.The horrible conditions of the city and the dreadful treatment Baha’u’llah and his companions received upon arrival were meant to signal their imminent demise and the end of Baha’u’llah’s cause.
                    Yet, Baha’u’llah’s description of that scene paints another picture entirely: Upon Our arrival, We were welcomed with banners of light, whereupon the Voice of the Spirit cried out saying: “Soon will all that dwell on earth be enlisted under these banners.” – Ibid., p. 184.
                    <br> <br> During Baha'u'llah's imprisonment in the barracks, visitors were rigidly excluded making some pilgrims arduous travels even more bitter sweet.
                    Several of the Bahá'is of Persia came all the way on foot for the purpose of seeing their beloved leader, but were refused admittance within the city walls. 
                    They used to go to a place on the plain outside the third moat, from which they could see the windows of Bahá'u'lláh's quarters. He would show Himself to them at one of the windows and after gazing on Him from afar, they would weep and return to their homes, fired with new zeal for sacrifice and service.
                    <br> <br> One extremely hot night, one of Baha’u’llah’s sons, Mirza Mihdi, fell through a skylight while pacing the roof of the prison, rapt in prayer. He fell onto some crates which mortally wounded him. 
                    Baha’u’llah found his son conscious and offered to save his life but, instead of asking to be healed, Mirza Mihdi’s dying wish to his father was for his life to be accepted as a ransom for those who were prevented from entering Baha’u’llah’s presence. Mirza Mihdi asked his father to accept the sacrifice of his life so that the pilgrims who had come from so far could meet, face to face, the messenger of God. 
                    <br> <br> Baha’u’llah granted his dying son’s request, and Mirza Mihdi was buried just outside the prison walls. In his writings, Baha’u’llah frequently praised his son’s selflessness and spirituality. On the day of Mirza Mihdi’s death, Baha’u’llah wrote:
                    
                    Glorified art Thou, O Lord, my God! … Thou seest me in the hands of Mine enemies, and My son blood-stained before Thy face, O Thou in Whose hands is the kingdom of all names. I have, O my Lord, offered up that which Thou hast given Me, that Thy servants may be quickened and all that dwell on earth be united. – Baha’u’llah, quoted by Shoghi Effendi in This Decisive Hour, p. 47.

                  <h1 class="f3 text--accent ttu"> House of `Abbud</h1>
                  <p>
                  Very soon after the death of his son, Baha’u’llah’s restricted confinement was lessened and he was allowed to live under house arrest in a nearby building.<br> 
                  What is now known as the House of `Abbud in `Akka is in two parts: the eastern part, which was the house of `Udi Khammar and the western part, which was the house of `Abbud himself.
                  The eastern section was so insufficient to the needs of Baha'u'llah and His family that no less than thirteen persons had to be accommodated in one of its rooms.
                  <br> Baha'u'llah had one room of the eastern section to Himself, and it was there that He revealed His Book of Laws, the Kitab-i-Aqdas (circa 1873).
                  Bahá'u'lláh also wrote the Fire Tablet here. He wrote the tablet in response to questions by a Bahá'í believer from Iran. 
                  The tablet is written in rhyming verse, has the form of a conversation between Bahá'u'lláh and God, and reflects the sufferings of Bahá'u'lláh. 
                  Bahá'ís often recite this tablet in times of difficulty.<br> <br> 
                  `Abbud turned over the western part of the house to the Baha'is. Baha'u'llah then gave His room in the eastern part of the house to His son,`Abdu'l-Baha, and occupied one of the rooms of the western section, which pilgrims now visit.
                  Once Bahá’u’lláh moved to the front of the house, He was better able to accommodate the flow of visitors, greeting them in His room.
                  In contrast with His previous room that faced a city square, this chamber had a view of the Mediterranean Sea.  Still under house arrest and not allowed to move about the prison city freely, Bahá’u’lláh went outside to this balcony frequently to greet His followers in the street below or to gaze upon the sea. 
                  Yet He longed to see greenery and to be in natural surroundings.

                  <h1 class="f3 text--accent ttu">The Ridván Garden</h1>
                  <p>The Ridván Garden, located outside the city of ‘Akká, was rented by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in 1875 and prepared for Bahá’u’lláh's use. 
                  Bahá’u’lláh visited this garden many times during the latter part of His life. For Bahá’u’lláh, the garden and the small building at the site provided a place of rest from the daily cares of His household and the pilgrims that thronged to see Him. 
                  The word "Ridván" means "Paradise."
                  During one period, Bahá’u’lláh stayed at the Ridván Garden for nine days, meeting with the pilgrim groups that came out each day from ‘Akká to see Him.<br> <br>
        
        
          Tuba Khanum, again wrote:<br>
        
          "On! the joy of the day when Baha’u’llah went to the beautiful Ridvan, which had been prepared for Him with such loving care by the Master, the friends, and the pilgrims!
          The Master’s heart was gladdened indeed to see the enjoyment of His beloved Father, resting under the big mulberry tree, by the side of the little river rippling by, the fountain which 
          they had contrived splashing and gurgling in sounds refreshing indeed after the long years of confinement in the pestilential air of the penal fortress of ‘Akka. 
          Only those who were present there could realize in any degree what it meant to be surrounded by such profusion flowers, their colours and their scents, after the dull walls and unfragrant odours of the prison city. "
                  <br> <br> In 1881, the Ridván Garden was purchased for Bahá’u’lláh. Pilgrims still go to the little house there for prayer and meditation.

                  <p>
                    In such esteem was Bahá’u’lláh held after many years of imprisonment in Akka that the local officials said that He was free to leave the prison city.
                    In late spring 1877 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá obtained permission from the owners of a pine grove near the Mansion of Bahjí outside ‘Akká to host a banquet for the notables of the city.
                    When they accepted ‘Abdu’l-Bahá's hospitality, it was clear that the order to keep Bahá’u’lláh within the prison city, although never formally revoked, would no longer be enforced.
                    After the banquet held by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá near Bahjí, the governor of ‘Akká confirmed that Bahá’u’lláh was free to live outside the walled city. <br><br>
        
                    John Esselmont in his book, Baha'u'llah and the New Era, recounts 'Abdu'l-Baha himself describing this period:<br>
          "Baha'u'llah loved the beauty and verdure of the country. One day He passed the remark: "I have not gazed on verdure for nine years. The country is the world of the soul, the city is the world of bodies." When I heard indirectly of this saying I realized that He was longing for the country, and I was sure that whatever I could do towards the carrying out of His wish would be successful. There was in Akka at that time a man called Muhammad Pasha Safwat, who was very much opposed to us. 
        
          He had a palace called Mazra'ih, about four miles north of the city, a lovely place, surrounded by gardens and with a stream of running water....I got the house at a very low rent, about five pounds per annum, paid him for five years and made a contract.
          I sent labourers to repair the place and put the garden in order and had a bath built. I also had a carriage prepared for the use of the Blessed Beauty." <br><br>
          
                    Bahá’u’lláh moved when He finally departed the walled prison city in early June 1877. 
                    He was to live two years in the house.
                    Although He was at first reluctant to avail Himself of this permission, He eventually was persuaded to leave the city for the Mansion of Mazra‘ih. <br> <br>
                    After years of strict confinement in the city of ‘Akká, Bahá’u’lláh found great enjoyment at Mazra‘ih.
                    In one tablet He describes in cheerful language the view of the sea on one side and the hills of Galilee on the other, and speaks of the charm of the trees laden with oranges that He likens to balls of fire.
                    The house itself was a stone building of simple design, set in gardens. The best view was eastward to the Galilee hills.Bahá’u’lláh lived in the house with members of His family and His amanuensis.
                    ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his sister, Bahíyyih Khánum, stayed back in the walled city of ‘Akká but visited frequently.

                  <h1 class="f3 text--accent ttu">The Mansion of Bahjí</h1>
                  <p>In the summer of 1879, there occurred one of those natural disasters for which Akka was the frequent host, an epidemic of plague erupted. 
                    Those who could do so wisely fled from the centre of the epidemic, included among those who abandoned the city and its environs were Udi Khammar and his family. 
                    `Abdu’l-Bahá relates its consequences for Baha’u’llah: 
                    It so happened that an epidemic disease had broken out at Bahjí, and the proprietor of the house fled away in distress, with all his family, ready to offer the house free of charge to any applicant. 
                    We took the house at a very low rent, and there the doors of majesty and true sovereignty were flung wide open. 
                    Named Bahjí (Delight), it was to be the home of Bahá’u’lláh for the remaining twelve and a half years of His life. <br><br>
          The mansion provided the space required by Bahá’u’lláh and His family to meet visitors and friends that came to see Him as His religion continued to grow beyond Iran and the Ottoman Empire.
          Bahá’u’lláh characterized the Mansion of Bahjí as the "lofty mansion,"the spot which "God hath ordained as the most sublime vision of mankind." <br> <br>
          While living there, Bahá’u’lláh wrote the last great work of his Ministry, the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf.<br>
          “In the name of God, the One, the Incomparable, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.
          Praise be to God, the Eternal that perisheth not, the Everlasting that declineth not, the Self-Subsisting that altereth not. 
          He it is Who is transcendent in His sovereignty, Who is manifest through His signs, and is hidden through His mysteries. 
          He it is at Whose bidding the standard of the Most Exalted Word hath been lifted up in the world of creation, and the banner of "He doeth whatsoever He willeth" raised amidst all peoples.” <br> <br>
        
          An Arabic inscription placed over the door by the original builder in 1870 reads: <br>
          "Greetings and salutation rest upon this Mansion which increaseth in splendour through the passage of time. Manifold wonders and marvels are found therein, and pens are baffled in attempting to describe them." <br> <br>
          The order of His imprisonment at ‘Akká having never been rescinded, Bahá’u’lláh stated concerning His days at Bahjí: <br>
          "Verily, verily, the most wretched prison has been converted into a Paradise of Eden."
          While at Bahjí, Bahá’u’lláh elucidated His teachings and sent tablets to various parts of the world. They included references to His most pivotal social teaching — the oneness of humankind.
          All His other social teachings are means of achieving and sustaining the practical unity of humanity so that people may fulfill the purpose of their creation, to peacefully carry forward an ever-advancing civilization.

The Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh, the holiest place on earth for Baha'is and the point toward which they turn in prayer each day, is located in Bahjí. Today, the Shrine consists of a light-filled, central room, striking in its simplicity and beauty. A garden stands in the middle of the room, which is surrounded by smaller rooms. In one corner of the central room is the chamber where Bahá’u’lláh’s remains are laid to rest. Over the years, this Holy Place has been beautified with formal gardens extending in a large circle around the shrine.  To set foot in the heart of the site is to enter a place of peace and serenity, a wall-less sanctuary that is protected without being enclosed.</p>
